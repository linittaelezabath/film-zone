🎬 Film Zone – React Movie Search App

Film Zone is a React-based web application that allows users to search for movies and view essential details such as the movie poster, release year, and type. The app fetches real-time movie data from the OMDb API and displays the results in a clean, responsive card-based UI.

This project was built to practice and demonstrate core React concepts including components, props, state management, hooks, and API integration.

🔑 API Used

OMDb API
Website: https://www.omdbapi.com/

The OMDb API is used to retrieve movie data based on the search query entered by the user.

📖 How the Application Works

On initial load, the app fetches movies related to "Batman".

The user enters a movie name in the search bar.

A request is sent to the OMDb API with the search term.

The response data is stored in the application state.

Movie results are rendered dynamically as movie cards.

📌 Learning Outcomes

⚠️ Notes

This project was created for learning and practice purposes.

The concept and API usage are inspired by common React tutorial projects.

Not intended for production deployment.

🔮 Future Enhancements
